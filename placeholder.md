Playing With Markdown

Wanna learn about line breaks? The following two sentences only have one line break between them...

I am Code Nit-Whit.
I am not so Nit Whitty.

The next paragraph has the same sentences, but now they are separated by two new line characters...

I am Code Nit-Whit.

I am not so Nit Whitty.


A bit of Coding
-------------------------

Some JS code... 

```javascript
var syntaxHighlighting = "awesome";
alert(syntaxHighlighting);
```

Math is hard, let's go shopping
-------------------------------

In school I learned that 6 > 2 and 3 < 7.

Here are some arrows. 2 -> 4 -> 6. 9 <- 6 <- 3.

Forever burned into my memory! a^2 + b^2 = c^2

We all like making lists
------------------------

The above header should be an H2 tag. Now, for a list of lists:

* Grocery List
* Bucket List
* Hit List

Some more wackiness:

1.  You want two paragraphs?

    You can have two paragraphs!

2.  But normal people use one...

Want some code **in** a list? The average person would think that is insane. But you aren't average, are you?

1. In HTML you can import styling like this:

        <link rel="stylesheet" href="yours.css">

2. In CSS, you can import OTHER styling like this:

        @import "style2.css";

Dopey people tend to need lists the mosts, but never use them.

<dl>
  <dt>Lower overhead</dt>
  <dd>Who needs to use their brain power when there is a perfectly losable piece of paper, right THERE!?</dd>
  <dt>Easier to use</dt>
  <dd>Well, for some.</dd>
</dl>

I Am Robot
------------

Maybe you want to print `robot` to the console 1000 times. Why not use C#?

    for(int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
        Console.WriteLine("robot");
    }

If that weren't inset 4 spaces, would it really be a tab? It definitely wouldn't look like code...

Can we break it with some angle braces and ampersands?

    <div class="footer">
        Â© 2020 Illuminati Corporation
    </div>

It's like 2D Minecraft!
------------

Preformatted blocks are useful for ASCII art:

<pre>
             ,-.
    ,     ,-.   ,-.
   / \   (   )-(   )
   \ |  ,.>-(   )-<
    \|,' (   )-(   )
     Y ___`-'   `-'
     |/__/   `-'
     |
     |
     |    -hrr-
  ___|_____________
</pre>

Who's to Blame?
----------------------

If you need a scapegoat, just quote someone:

> I hated him... -Not the Killer

Maybe get a little unexpected?:

> I wish you'd have given me this request for a quote ahead of time so I
> could plan for it... I'm sure something will pop into my head here in
> the midst of all this programming, with all the pressure of trying to
> come up with something clever, but it hadn't yet...
>
> I don't want to sound like
> I'm perfect. I'm confident I'm not. I just haven't - you
> just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet
> as I should be in coming up with something for you.

Table for Two
-------------

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Rank</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td><td>Tom Preston-Werner</td><td>Awesome</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>2</td><td>Albert Einstein</td><td>Nearly as awesome</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Crazy linking action
--------------------

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google] [1] than from
[Yahoo] [2] or [MSN] [3].

  [1]: https://google.com/        "Google"
  [2]: http://search.yahoo.com/  "Yahoo Search"
  [3]: http://search.msn.com/    "MSN Search"
